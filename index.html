                <p>My cohort was given a month of information training before starting floor training. During this time, I was tasked to become familiar with medical terminology including ...

                    Prior to floor training, we were given a comprehensive introduction to Cerner Systems and which mechanisms to use to best make use of time. I passed all administered quizzes with greater than 95% to be cleared to advance with floor training.

                    Durning floor training, I was under the direct supervision of a Lead Scribe in a normal shift setting. I started with learning how to take notes and use abbreviations to not only keep up with providers but also document all information given. We were given 6 training shifts to cover all of the time slots that are available including an early morning, night, and afternoon shift. With the last floor training,I was cleared to work independently and given the feedback:

                <p>Each provider has different preferences as I was expected to scribe based on their preferences. Some doctors prefer to read their own x-rays and others want the scribe to notify them if a radiologist reads them. From this, I was able to advance by ability to multitask and be able to handle many different sources of information at once.

                <p>Also, since our hospital switched over to StatRad over the night, I had to keep track of both the patient’s charts and radiology readings in a different section. In many cases, I just came back from visiting a patient with a provider and had notes I had to input into their chart, but as patients have different acuities, I would check other notes before putting in new ones. This allowed me to understand how to prioritize by workflow in a busy environment and lessen the chance of becoming overwhelmed with my responsibilities.

            <p>
                Working in the ED gave me a very different view on how providers need to handle their patients. They have to balance the acuity of the patient with the length of stay that they have. Additionally, in many cases, they need to correlate many different views of an incident to treat the patient. 
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the main things that I learned was to never ask a patient what they want. In many cases when someone is in the ED, they are too overwhelmed and are looking at the provider for guidance. While it may seem nicer to give the patient more options, it might actually put them in decision paralysis. In this case, providers have taught me how to guide a patient without compromising their personal choice. 

            </p>
            <p>
                I hope to further explore the medical field and understand the reasoning for the decisions that providers make. I have learned so much in the little time that i have worked here and am excited for any new opportunities and experience that will follow.

                <p>One of the most memorable stories was a patient in his 70s had accidentally burned his facility. He was sleeping with a lit cigarette when it fell out of his mouth and caught the blanket on fire. He was sent to the center for his burns but after he was healed, no nursing facility would have him in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He seemed to always want some sort of nursing help, whether that be to get him a blanket, sit him up, get him food or water. His burns were all healed but he seemed like the most needy patient.

                </p>
                <p>
                    On one shift when I had time to sit down and talk to him, he was a really sweet guy; always wanting to know more about me or how the nurses have been. When I asked if he minded staying in the hospital for this long, at that point it had been around 180 days, he said 
                </p>

                    <tr>
                        <th>
                            "I didn't get much talking to there. It's much more homely here"
                        </th>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p>While I have heard of how it is at facilities, this was one of the first times it hit me about the environment there. Physically he was fully healed, but mentally he never wanted to leave. 
                    This taught me how much ‘medically cleared’ might not show the full picture. A person’s health is not just if their physical body works, but also how they feel about themselves and the environment they are surrounded by.

                <p>I learned more about the nursing side of patient care. While it can be routine, with taking vitals every 8 hours or giving daily medications, people also change drastically day-to-day. The minimal tasks that nurses do to keep patients comfortable are no less important than the orders that doctors put in. The whole team, with PT walking the patient down the hall, allows the patient to heal and nothing done is truly a one-person job.
